# Healthcare Policy Funding Analysis

Project Description – Healthcare Policy Funding Analysis

This project looks at how medical residency programs affect hospitals and how federal funding (DGME payments) is spread across different states. The goal is to understand whether the money hospitals get for training new doctors is fair, and how it connects to patient care and hospital performance.

**Key Research Questions**

   a) How does the ratio of interns/residents to hospital beds affect hospital utilization (total hospital days, bed days available)?
   
   b) Do DGME payment allocations (Total, Part A/C, and Part B) vary significantly across states and by the number of residents?
   
   c) Do large and urban hospitals benefit more from residency programs than smaller or rural hospitals?
   
   d) Are smaller or rural states systematically underfunded compared to larger, wealthier states?
   
   

**What We Did**

   a) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Examined distributions and correlations between intern/bed ratios, hospital utilization metrics, and DGME payments.
   
   b) Statistical Modeling: Regression models to estimate the effect of intern ratios on utilization and funding.
   
   c) Comparative Analysis: Cross-state comparisons of DGME allocations (e.g., CA vs. AL vs. MS vs. NY).
   
   d) Forecasting: Used historical data (2014–2024) to project hospital revenue and patient volumes through 2028.
   
   

**Key Findings**

   a) Hospitals with more interns/residents generally have higher patient activity and utilization, though the intern-per-bed ratio alone is a weak predictor.
   
   b) Large and urban hospitals benefit more from adding residents, while small or rural hospitals often gain little or even experience negative effects.
   
   c) DGME funding is unevenly distributed — states like New York and California receive disproportionately higher payments, while smaller states receive far less.
   
   d) Forecasts suggest that disparities will widen further through 2028 without policy reform.

This analysis shows that the current DGME funding system favors big teaching hospitals in large states, leaving rural and smaller hospitals underfunded. To build a more balanced healthcare system, funding rules need to be updated so that resources are distributed more fairly..
